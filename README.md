# Object-Oriented-Programming-Python
Object Oriented Programming Python is a python class library that has some new features and force you to use python in a object oriented way.
Object-Oriented-Programming-Python is runs on Python3 witch means that as long as you have Python3 Install you can use this. (most will work with Python2.7 as well)

you only write in the main file and from the main file you can access other files as well, but, you need to run it with the "open.py" file or it will just do nothing
