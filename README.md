THIS IS AN OLD PROJECT, It is really bad and if i remember correctly it does not work proporly!

# Object-Oriented-Programming-Python
Object Oriented Programming Python is a python class library that has some new features and force you to use python in a object oriented way.
Object-Oriented-Programming-Python is runs on Python3 which means that as long as you have Python3 Install you can use this. (most will work with Python2.7 as well)

you only write in the main file(you can access other python files as well but main is the main one), but, you need to run it with the "open.py" file or it will just do nothing.

Object-Oriented-Programming-Python is completely open sourced and if you want to know how to use it, you can simple read the "oopp.py"
file and see for your self what evey class dose :)
